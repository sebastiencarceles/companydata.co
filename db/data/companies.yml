  we finance it, too. It’s more important than ever that the industries sustaining
  our lives get the support they deserve. At GE Capital, we use the scale, intelligence
  and sheer inventiveness that’s in our DNA to do just that — whether it’s being the
  partner of choice for the first world or developing opportunities for the emerging
  world, we have the talent and the capability to make a better world anywhere we
  invest. And that’s why GE Capital is different. We’re more than a product or service.
  We create relationships that support the growth of every customer with whom we partner.

  industries that matter most. And we’ve got plans for the future. The new GE Capital

presentation: 'Ensemble Studios was a game development studio based in Dallas, Texas
  (USA). It was established in 1995 by Tony Goodman, John Boog-Scott and Rick Goodman.
  Previously Tony Goodman had founded the information technology company Ensemble
  Corporation in 1991 together with John Boog-Scott, John Calhoun, and Thad Chapman.
  Ensemble Corporation was acquired by USWeb Corporation in 1997, Ensemble Studios
  was acquired by Microsoft in 2001. Ensemble Studios is most famous for having established
  the Age of Empires series of strategy games, which has seen installments for over
  ten years (1997-2007) and still lives on in titles such as Age of Empires Online
  (2011). In September 2008 it was confirmed Microsoft would shut down the studio
  following the release of Halo Wars, as a fiscally-rooted decision. The closure of
  Ensemble led to the formation of many new development studios by former employees:
  • Tony Goodman, along with a number of veteran developers, announced in February
  2009 to have founded the studio Robot Entertainment. • A second team of about 35
  developers announced to have founded Bonfire Studios (now Zynga Dallas) in the same
  month, headed by David Rippy. • Dusty Monk established Windstorm Studios. • The
  brothers Paul Bettner and David Bettner founded Newtoy, Inc. (now Zynga With Friends).
  • The brothers Tommy Bean and Michael Bean established Pixelocity Software (after
  briefly working at Robot Entertainment) • Jeff Ruediger co-founded the mobile game
  development studio Fuzzycube Software in March 2009. • Graeme Devine established
  GRL Games in 2010.'

  model of growth for our business. The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan sets out
  to decouple our growth from our environmental impact, while at the same time increasing
  our positive social impact. Our Plan has three big goals that by 2020 will enable
  us to: - Help more than a billion people to improve their health and well-being.
  - Halve the environmental footprint of our products. - Source 100% of our agricultural
  raw materials sustainably and enhance the livelihoods of people across our value
  chain. We believe that as a business we have a responsibility to our consumers and
  to the communities in which we have a presence. Around the world we invest in local
  economies and develop people’s skills inside and outside of Unilever. And through
  our business and brands, we run a range of programmes to promote hygiene, nutrition,
  empowerment and environmental awareness.'

  addressing and solving some of the most important unmet medical needs of our time.
  We are driven to action by the plight of patients, and we aspire to make a positive

  for us doesn’t stop in our labs. The world is our lab, and we wouldn’t be able to
  achieve our success if it weren’t for our approach to collaboration. We work closely
  with like-minded people from researchers to governments, healthcare professionals

  to market access and patient education. Our experts collaborate with external parties
  at every stage of our value chain—from early discovery to market access. We seek

specialities: Biotechnology from R&D to manufacturing and marketing
presentation: Subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, Centocor is a biotechnology company
  that was founded in Philadelphia in 1979 with an initial goal of developing new
  diagnostic assays using monoclonal antibody technology. In 1982 Centocor developed
  their first product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) — a
  diagnostic test used to detect the rabies virus, and in that same year transitioned
  into a publicly traded company. Subsequently, the company moved to a larger facility
  in Malvern, Pennsylvania (a northwest suburb of Philadelphia). In 1984, Centocor
  opened an overseas plant in Leiden, the Netherlands. Eighteen years after its foundation,
  (in 1997), Centocor achieved its first year of operating profitability. In 1998,
  Centocor divested itself of its diagnostic division and launched its top-selling
  monoclonal antibody Remicade (infliximab) for its first FDA approved indication
  in Crohn's Disease. In 1999, Centocor became a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson
  & Johnson, the worldwide manufacturer and marketer of healthcare products. Subsequently,
  Remicade's market has expanded with approvals for rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing
  spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and pediatric Crohn's disease.
  Remicade was approved for plaque psoriasis in September 2006. Centocor also markets
  ReoPro (abciximab), a biologic agent indicated as an adjunct to coronary angioplasty
  (PTCA). Since being acquired by Johnson and Johnson, Centocor has increased its
  annual sales from approximately $500 million to more than $2 billion. During the
  same period, research and development investment increased from $75 million to more
  than $300 million. In 2004 Centocor purchased a new manufacturing plant in St. Louis,
  Missouri, and is currently opening a new manufacturing facility in County Cork,
  Ireland. The Dutch plant has been expanded substantially with a $250 million investment
  in additional production facilities, which were opened in 2006.

presentation: The U.S. Navy is comprised of more than 500,000 Sailors and civilians,
  nearly 300 ships and submarines, and more than 3,700 aircraft. Our Sailors serve
  on the water (aboard ships); under the water (aboard submarines); over the water
  (in planes and helicopters) and away from the water (ashore in the U.S. and around
  the world). What happens on the water affects us all. To understand the impact the
  U.S. Navy makes in our daily lives, think of the 70-80-90 rule. Seventy percent
  of the earth is covered by water, 80 percent of the earth's population lives near
  the ocean, and 90 percent of international trade travels by sea. The U.S. Navy meets
  threats far away, so those threats cannot harm our citizens at home. They protect
  and defend freedom around the world and also offer opportunities for a great career.

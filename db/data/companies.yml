  we finance it, too. It’s more important than ever that the industries sustaining
  our lives get the support they deserve. At GE Capital, we use the scale, intelligence
  and sheer inventiveness that’s in our DNA to do just that — whether it’s being the
  partner of choice for the first world or developing opportunities for the emerging
  world, we have the talent and the capability to make a better world anywhere we
  invest. And that’s why GE Capital is different. We’re more than a product or service.
  We create relationships that support the growth of every customer with whom we partner.
  We’re a team of the brightest minds in finance – with unmatchable expertise in the
  industries that matter most. And we’ve got plans for the future. The new GE Capital

  solutions as our company continues to build, move, power and cure the world. The

presentation: 'Ensemble Studios was a game development studio based in Dallas, Texas
  (USA). It was established in 1995 by Tony Goodman, John Boog-Scott and Rick Goodman.
  Previously Tony Goodman had founded the information technology company Ensemble
  Corporation in 1991 together with John Boog-Scott, John Calhoun, and Thad Chapman.
  Ensemble Corporation was acquired by USWeb Corporation in 1997, Ensemble Studios
  was acquired by Microsoft in 2001. Ensemble Studios is most famous for having established
  the Age of Empires series of strategy games, which has seen installments for over
  ten years (1997-2007) and still lives on in titles such as Age of Empires Online
  (2011). In September 2008 it was confirmed Microsoft would shut down the studio
  following the release of Halo Wars, as a fiscally-rooted decision. The closure of
  Ensemble led to the formation of many new development studios by former employees:
  • Tony Goodman, along with a number of veteran developers, announced in February
  2009 to have founded the studio Robot Entertainment. • A second team of about 35
  developers announced to have founded Bonfire Studios (now Zynga Dallas) in the same
  month, headed by David Rippy. • Dusty Monk established Windstorm Studios. • The
  brothers Paul Bettner and David Bettner founded Newtoy, Inc. (now Zynga With Friends).
  • The brothers Tommy Bean and Michael Bean established Pixelocity Software (after
  briefly working at Robot Entertainment) • Jeff Ruediger co-founded the mobile game
  development studio Fuzzycube Software in March 2009. • Graeme Devine established
  GRL Games in 2010.'

  and wellbeing, no company touches so many people’s lives in so many different ways.
  Our portfolio ranges from nutritionally balanced foods to indulgent ice creams,

specialities: Biotechnology from R&D to manufacturing and marketing
presentation: Subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, Centocor is a biotechnology company
  that was founded in Philadelphia in 1979 with an initial goal of developing new
  diagnostic assays using monoclonal antibody technology. In 1982 Centocor developed
  their first product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) — a
  diagnostic test used to detect the rabies virus, and in that same year transitioned
  into a publicly traded company. Subsequently, the company moved to a larger facility
  in Malvern, Pennsylvania (a northwest suburb of Philadelphia). In 1984, Centocor
  opened an overseas plant in Leiden, the Netherlands. Eighteen years after its foundation,
  (in 1997), Centocor achieved its first year of operating profitability. In 1998,
  Centocor divested itself of its diagnostic division and launched its top-selling
  monoclonal antibody Remicade (infliximab) for its first FDA approved indication
  in Crohn's Disease. In 1999, Centocor became a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson
  & Johnson, the worldwide manufacturer and marketer of healthcare products. Subsequently,
  Remicade's market has expanded with approvals for rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing
  spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and pediatric Crohn's disease.
  Remicade was approved for plaque psoriasis in September 2006. Centocor also markets
  ReoPro (abciximab), a biologic agent indicated as an adjunct to coronary angioplasty
  (PTCA). Since being acquired by Johnson and Johnson, Centocor has increased its
  annual sales from approximately $500 million to more than $2 billion. During the
  same period, research and development investment increased from $75 million to more
  than $300 million. In 2004 Centocor purchased a new manufacturing plant in St. Louis,
  Missouri, and is currently opening a new manufacturing facility in County Cork,
  Ireland. The Dutch plant has been expanded substantially with a $250 million investment
  in additional production facilities, which were opened in 2006.

  Center is comprised of a headquarters organization in Newport, R.I. and two major
  divisions in Newport, R.I. and Keyport, Wash. In addition to the Naval Undersea
  Warfare Center, NAVSEA's Warfare Center Enterprise includes the Naval Surface Warfare
  Center. With eight surface warfare and two undersea warfare divisions across the
  United States, the Warfare Centers supply the technical operations, people, technology,
  engineering services and products needed to equip and support the fleet and meet
  the warfighters' needs. The Warfare Centers are the Navy's principal research, development,
  test and evaluation assessment activity for surface ship and submarine systems and
  subsystems. In addition, the Warfare Centers provide depot maintenance and in-service
  engineering support to ensure the systems fielded today perform consistently and
  reliably in the future.

presentation: The U.S. Navy is comprised of more than 500,000 Sailors and civilians,
  nearly 300 ships and submarines, and more than 3,700 aircraft. Our Sailors serve
  on the water (aboard ships); under the water (aboard submarines); over the water
  (in planes and helicopters) and away from the water (ashore in the U.S. and around
  the world). What happens on the water affects us all. To understand the impact the
  U.S. Navy makes in our daily lives, think of the 70-80-90 rule. Seventy percent
  of the earth is covered by water, 80 percent of the earth's population lives near
  the ocean, and 90 percent of international trade travels by sea. The U.S. Navy meets
  threats far away, so those threats cannot harm our citizens at home. They protect
  and defend freedom around the world and also offer opportunities for a great career.

  for themselves and their families. Our culture is based on our values rooted in
  respect: respect for ourselves, respect for others, respect for diversity and respect
  for the future. We can trace our origin back to 1866, when the first European condensed
  milk factory was opened in Cham, Switzerland, by the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk
  Company. One year later, Henri Nestlé, a trained pharmacist, launched one of the
  world’s first prepared infant cereals ‘Farine lactée’ in Vevey, Switzerland. Today,
  we employ around 328,000 people and have factories or operations in almost every
  country in the world. With our headquarters still based in the Swiss town of Vevey,
  we had sales of CHF 89.5 billion in 2016. Our portfolio covers almost every food
  and beverage category –offering products and services for all stages of life, every
  moment of the day, helping people care for themselves and their families.'

  What was true back then is still true today. Back in the nineties, our small team
  worked hard to bring games on new platforms. In those days the internet was still
  young, and modems reigned supreme.* Always keen for a new challenge, we spotted
  a new type of game making waves – the massively multiplayer online RPG** Our founders
  took a chance and built Dark Age of Camelot.*** Most thought it wouldn’t work. But
  doubters were all proven wrong. Dark Age of Camelot changed gaming forever. Since
  then, we have had our share of good times, challenging times, a people who have
  come and gone. We have become a part of the EA family, delivered Warhammer Online:
  Age of Reckoning and Wrath of Heroes, become stewards of Ultima Online, supported
  Star Wars: The Old Republic, and much much more Now, we have a new gaming revolution
  – the Move to Mobile – firmly in our sites. We’ve returned to small teams making
  exciting games with new technology. Within these walls, idealist souls spend their
  working days creating digital interactive entertainment. It’s a bunch of gamers
  doing what they love. It’s done with magic, caffeine, a TARDIS****, and wide-eyed
  joy for the wonderful world of computer gaming. *Ask your parents ** Also called
  an MMORPG *** A damn fine game if we do say so ourselves **** Ask a Dr. Who fan
  TL;DR We are a bunch of Gamers doing what we love!'

presentation: Hughes Supply was a residential electrical supply distributor founded
  by Clarence Hughes and his son, Russell, in Orlando, FL in 1928. For the next two
  decades, we weathered the Great Depression and World War II with slow but steady
  expansion in Florida. In response to growing demand from customers who performed
  electrical and plumbing work, Hughes Supply added plumbing supplies to its distribution
  in the 1940s. Throughout the next 20 years, we expanded even further in Florida.
  In 1970, Hughes Supply went public, offering 350,000 shares of common stock at an
  initial price of $17.60 per share. We celebrated our 50th anniversary in 1978 and
  threw quite a party! We hosted a trade show for customers and vendors. It was the
  largest show of its type organized by a single company in the industry…a distinction
  we still hold today. Up to this point, nearly all of our business was in residential
  construction in Florida. But knowing housing starts can be unpredictable, we spent
  the next few decades diversifying our products, expanding geographically through
  acquisitions and targeting commercial construction. By the mid 2000s, we were in
  the Southeast, Midwest and Pacific regions. In January 2006, Hughes Supply was acquired
  by The Home Depot’s HD Supply division. For the next five years, we continued to
  provide trusted service under the HD Supply trade name. On September 12, 2011, we
  joined Hajoca Corporation’s diverse family and reclaimed our namesake. We’re proud
  of the Hughes Supply legacy. We’re proud to call you family. If you have any questions
  about what it will mean for you, please see our frequently asked questions section
  or contact us at any time.

  Canadian government is to ensure and support the country''s economic performance.
  Its other responsibilities include national defence, interprovincial and international
  trade and commerce, immigration, banking and the monetary system, criminal law and
  fisheries. The federal government also oversees such industries as aeronautics,

presentation: Amazon strives to be Earth's most customer-centric company where people
  can find and discover virtually anything they want to buy online. By giving customers
  more of what they want - low prices, vast selection, and convenience - Amazon continues
  to grow and evolve as a world-class e-commerce platform. Founded by Jeff Bezos,
  the Amazon.com website started in 1995 as a place to buy books because of the unique
  customer experience the Web could offer book lovers. Bezos believed that only the
  Internet could offer customers the convenience of browsing a selection of millions
  of book titles in a single sitting. During the first 30 days of business, Amazon
  fulfilled orders for customers in 50 states and 45 countries - all shipped from
  his Seattle-area garage. Amazon's evolution from Web site to e-commerce partner
  to development platform is driven by the spirit of innovation that is part of the
  company's DNA. The world's brightest technology minds come to Amazon.com to research
  and develop technology that improves the lives of shoppers and sellers around the
  world.

  focuses on the discovery, development and commercialisation of prescription medicines.
  Our Purpose is to push the boundaries of science to deliver life-changing medicines.
  We believe the best way we can achieve our Purpose is to put science at the centre
  of everything we do. Science defines who we are. It is why we come to work every
  day and is part of our DNA. But this is only half of the story. We know that we
  do not have all the answers. We want to share ideas because we believe it results
  in better medicines. We want the way we work to be inclusive, open and collaborative.
  This approach runs through all that we do. We focus on three main therapy areas
  – Oncology, Cardiovascular & Metabolic Disease (CVMD) and Respiratory – and we are
  also selectively active in the areas of autoimmunity, neuroscience and infection.
  To put ourselves in the best position to push the boundaries of science, we seek
  to leverage our combination of capabilities, which encompass both small molecules
  and biologics, and include immunotherapies and developing innovative delivery devices
  that can offer choice to patients. These are reinforced by a strong focus on personalised
  healthcare capabilities, which aim to match medicines only to those patients who
  will benefit from them. Our teams also work alongside the world's leading academic
  and biotech research institutions to stimulate innovation and evaluate emerging
  technologies such as Modified RNA and CRISPR genome editing. AstraZeneca operates
  in over 100 countries and its innovative medicines are used by millions of patients
  worldwide. For more information, visit www.astrazeneca.com.

  was simple. Don couldn’t find a pair of jeans that fit. They never expected to transform
  retail. But they did. Guided by humility, compassion and a strong desire to win,
  the Fishers grew their company thoughtfully. Customers responded. Today, Gap Inc.
  is a leading international specialty retailer with five brands – Gap, Banana Republic,
  Old Navy, Athleta and INTERMIX – almost 3,200 stores and more than 150,000 employees.
  We’re growing globally, and just within the last few years, we opened our first
  stores in China and Italy. We''re expanding online shopping to customers, too. Today,
  customers in about 90 countries can buy our products. While many things have changed
  since 1969, the principles on which we were founded have stayed the same: creativity,
  delivering results, doing what’s right and always thinking of our customers first.'

  reach and engage with specific audience segments. Our geographic segmentation tools
  reach the sub-DMA level, presenting more relevant messages to distinct audiences,

  invite consumers to learn more about a product or service. By partnering with other
  cable companies and television providers (satellite/telephone) in many markets to
  form interconnects, we make buying local advertising easier. Advertisers can now
  reach most “pay TV” homes in a market with one-stop shopping and a standardized,
  consistent buying experience across multiple markets. With a consistent lineup of
  more than 50 networks across our markets, Comcast Spotlight makes it easy for regional
  and national advertisers to buy the same demographically targeted television and
  digital networks across multiple markets. We work with the top names in research
  to help our clients understand how their target audiences consume media. The process
  begins with a custom needs analysis for each advertiser, serving as the foundation
  for a media plan designed specifically to achieve that advertiser’s goals. Cable
  television brands are incredibly valuable and highly recognizable. Our clients can
  take advantage of the great affinity viewers have for cable networks and shows to
  create customized marketing initiatives leveraging the strong connection between
  viewers and their favorite programs. To learn more about out cable television and
  digital advertising solutions, please visit www.comcastspotlight.com

presentation: The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)
  is a United Nations court of law dealing with war crimes that took place during
  the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990’s. Since its establishment in 1993 it has
  irreversibly changed the landscape of international humanitarian law and provided
  victims an opportunity to voice the horrors they witnessed and experienced. In its
  precedent-setting decisions on genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity,
  the Tribunal has shown that an individual’s senior position can no longer protect
  them from prosecution. The Tribunal has laid the foundations for what is now the
  accepted norm for conflict resolution and post-conflict development across the globe,
  specifically that leaders suspected of mass crimes will face justice. The Tribunal
  has proved that efficient and transparent international justice is possible. The
  Tribunal is based in The Hague, the Netherlands, with regional offices in Bosnia
  and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo and Serbia.

presentation: 'Bayer’s Crop Science division is the third largest innovative agricultural
  input company in the world. We help make the agricultural economy more productive
  thus contributing to society by helping to ensure an ample supply of high-quality
  food, feed, fiber and renewable raw materials. The opportunities and challenges
  driving the global agricultural community are complex and daunting. A growing world
  population, changing dietary habits and volatile weather – to name just a few –
  are affecting agricultural production today and in the future. How can we increase
  productivity and achieve food security for what will be close to 10 billion people
  by 2050? How can we help plants thrive in changing climatic conditions? How can
  we best support the growers, from subsistence farmers to large-scale farming operations?
  And how can we assure that only high-quality and safe food reaches the consumer?
  We are committed to helping tackle these challenges through our expertise in high
  value seeds, innovative chemical and biological crop protection solutions, and services
  for modern, sustainable agriculture. Addressing some of the major challenges in
  modern agriculture requires fresh answers. A higher stress-tolerance of plants in
  face of increasing weather volatility will be as important as developing innovative
  solutions to control pests, plant diseases and weeds. As an innovation leader in
  our industry, our goal is to develop first- and best-in-class solutions in seeds
  as well as chemical and biological crop protection. Fostering an environment of
  collaboration across different disciplines, cultures and markets, we cooperate with
  external partners and recognize the importance of local knowledge, striving to combine
  it with our global expertise. Imprint: https://www.cropscience.bayer.com/en/policies/imprint'

  of the last century. McCann is part of McCann Wordgroup, one of the world''s largest
  marketing communications networks united by a single mission: to help brands play
  a meaningful role in people’s lives. This commitment focuses on creating work that
  earns a role in people’s lives by being interesting, evocative and useful. It’s
  powerful and effective creativity that helps clients grow their brands and businesses.
  The modern McCann Erickson is the result of a 1930 merger in New York between two
  pioneer agencies, The H. K. McCann Company, which opened in 1912, and The Erickson
  Company, founded in 1902. The two agency principals themselves were industry visionaries
  whose contributions encompassed establishing the core general practices and central
  ethical guidelines of the industry. This included their roles in helping to launch
  the American Association of Advertising Agencies and the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
  From the beginning, The H.K. McCann Company declared itself dedicated to creating
  a multiple office network built on collaboration and shared best-in-class resources
  designed to help all of its clients maximize their growth potential. After opening
  in New York and expanding quickly across the U.S., McCann launched on its collaborative
  worldwide trajectory, opening in Canada in 1915, in Europe in 1927, in Latin America
  in 1935, in Australia in 1959, and in Asia in 1960. Along the way, it was McCann
  in the 1950s and early 1960s that introduced coordinated marketing communications,
  incorporating such areas as public relations and sales promotion.'

  het kernproces van de bank, het betalingsverkeer. Hieruit blijkt al dat we anders
  denken en doen. Voor onze ICT-ers betekent dit concreet: werk met meer inhoud. De
  impact van wat je doet op onze organisatie is groot. In multidisciplinaire teams
  ben je van A tot Z bij projecten betrokken. En je levert een zinvolle bijdrage aan
  onze drive om zowel nationaal als internationaal toonaangevend te zijn. Ben je net

specialities: 
presentation: The NHS was launched in 1948. It was born out of a long-held ideal that
  good healthcare should be available to all, regardless of wealth – one of the NHS's
  core principles. With the exception of some charges, such as prescriptions, optical
  services and dental services, the NHS in England remains free at the point of use
  for all UK residents. This currently stands at more than 64.6 million people in
  the UK and 54.3 million people in England alone. The NHS in England deals with over
  1 million patients every 36 hours. It covers everything, including antenatal screening,
  routine screenings (such as the NHS Health Check), treatments for long-term conditions,
  transplants, emergency treatment and end-of-life care. Responsibility for healthcare
  in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales is devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly,
  the Scottish Government and the Welsh Assembly Government respectively. The NHS
  employs more than 1.5 million people, putting it in the top five of the world’s
  largest workforces, together with the US Department of Defence, McDonalds, Walmart
  and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army. The NHS in England is the biggest part
  of the system by far, catering to a population of 54.3 million and employing around
  1.2 million people. Of those, the clinically qualified staff include 150,273 doctors,
  40,584 general practitioners (GPs), 314,966 nurses and health visitors, 18,862 ambulance
  staff, and 111,127 hospital and community health service (HCHS) medical and dental
  staff. The NHS in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland employs 161,415; 84,000 and
  66,000 people respectively.
